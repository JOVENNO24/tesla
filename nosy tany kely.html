    <h1>NOSY TANY KELY</h1>
    <h2>description:</h2>
    <p>Nosy Tanikely is a protected marine reserve 10km south of Nosy Be. <br>It's one of the best
        snorkelling sites in the area, with coral, numerous fish and sea turtles.<br> Snorkelling is best in the morning,
        before the wind picks up.<br>
        The Nosy Tanikely marine reserve, with its abundant coral reefs and exceptional biodiversity<br> provides
        habitats for numerous underwater species.<br>
        The warm tropical waters and alluvial deposits from the Sambirano River<br> mean that a large number of
        species have made this small islet their home.<br> Indeed, a varied and spectacular fauna lives all around the
        island.<br>
        Nosy Antanihely means “the island of small land”. <br>It is an uninhabited islet that is also of scenic interest
        to those less interested in the seabed.<br> Visitors can go there on day trips, but cannot sleep on the island<br>
        
        Access to the island has been controlled since 2010.<br> A 700m radius around the lighthouse marks the
        boundary of the nature reserve zone.<br>
        The infrastructure on site is very modest: a reception, a picnic area, an interpretation centre and toilets.<br>
        
        It is best spot for Snorkelling:
        Grab your flippers, mask and snorkel and enjoy the pleasures of snorkelling at Tanikely.<br> Observe the
        corals and underwater fauna from the surface or by snorkelling<br>
        With its soft sand and turquoise waters, Nosy Tanikely’s beaches are a paradise,<br> ideal for a pleasant
        swim or siesta under the vegetation, sheltered from the sun.
