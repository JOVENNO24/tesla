    like always i do my job in my heart;in that time there was rain during our trip because we were in raining season<br>
    i was trying to do my best shot to get my clients to be satisfied from their trip<br>
    once we got at the place we expected to go ; we had greatconversation <br>then one of them was starting to ask about me "why i became a tour guide"<br>
    i answered clearly with the thing i went through till i became a tour guide<br>he said to me if we help you what do you choose ,as long as i am still young  i choosed to study again without hesitation<br>
 he put the question what do you preffer to study <br>and i said what i preffer to study is programming language ,building software, etc...<br>
    he told me" good choice me and my team we'll think about that"; then we exchanged the contact <br>
    a few months later , he sent message to me by saying ok we are ready to help you tell me what do you need for study <br>
