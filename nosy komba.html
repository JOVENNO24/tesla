    <h1>NOSY KOMBA</h1>
    <h2>description:</h2>
    <p>Nosy Komba is a circular volcanic island, located in the northwest of Madagascar, 7km from Hell-Ville in Nosy Be.<br> The position of its geographical centre is 13°47 / 48°34.<br> The island covers an area of 25 km2.
        The island of lemurs measures 6.5km in its greatest length and 5km in its greatest width.<br> Its summit reaches more than 622m.<br>
        
        Nosy Komba is home to many lemurs of the same species, the macaco makis.<br> These small cuddly animals, which live in groups led by one or two females<br> populate the forests of the island and attract visitors who come specially to see them.<br>
        With no roads, cars or electricity, Nosy Komba is a peaceful place.<br> In this small corner of the world, one lives to the rhythm of the sun and the sailing pirogues, as if time had stopped.<br>
        
        This magnificent island, as much by its nature as by the gentle way of life of its inhabitants <br> charms the visitor as soon as he arrives, and bewitches those who linger there.
